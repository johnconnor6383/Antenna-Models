# Antenna-Models

A collection of various antenna models.

Some are in the YO/YW format, a small table which is very easy to work with.
Others are EZNEC files, not quite so easy to work with.

These have come from a variety of sources. Some are off the web, some have been composed by me. In almost every case, I have modeled the antenna in YW and/or EZNEC, so there is at least a reasonable chance that the model is sensible.

But - you know - use them at your own risk. No warranty is implied whatsoever. There might be all kinds of stupid errors. You are on your own to verify the models.
